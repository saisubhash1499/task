<p>Between 1969 and 1974, and again between 1989 and 2002, 
Nissan produced a high performance version of its Skyline coupe called the Nissan Skyline GT-R.
This car proved to be iconic for Nissan[5][6] and achieved much fame and success on both road and track. 
The Nissan GT-R, now a standalone model no longer based on the Skyline, has heritage in the Nissan Skyline GT-R.
Similar to the later generations of the Skyline GT-R, the GT-R is four-wheel drive with a twin-turbo 6 cylinder engine and has the signature four round tail lights. 
However, the GT-R is an entirely new model sharing little with its Skyline siblings and is a complete redesign from previous Skylines rather than an incremental evolution; the four-wheel-steering HICAS system has been removed and the former straight-6 RB26DETT engine has been replaced with a new V6 VR38DETT.
[7] Because of the GT-R's heritage, the chassis code for the all-new version has been called CBA-R35,[8] or 'R35' for short (where CBA is the prefix for emission standard), carrying on the naming trend from previous Skyline GT-R generations. The GT-R has also retained its Skyline predecessor's nickname Godzilla,[9] given to it by the Australian motoring publication Wheels in its July 1989 edition.</p>
